# Saving and Loading trained machine learning models

# Two ways to save and load machine learning models:
# 1. with python's "pickle" module
# 2. with the "joblib" module

#Pickle - the pickle module implements binary protocols for serializing and deserializing a Python object structure
import pickle
#Save
